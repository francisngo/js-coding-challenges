# Review of Coding Challenge

#### Questions asked:
1. What does Math.random() return?
- Math.random() static method returns a floating-point, pseudo random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1.

2. How can you improve this application?
- Add unit testing - Jest for utils function, React Testing Library for testing components 
- Add automated testing - propose implementing other forms of tests such as integration testing, end-to-end-testing, or performance testing, to ensure application behaves as expected in different scenarios
- Optimize performance - analyze the application for any performance bottlenecks such as slow loading times or inefficient algorithms, and propose optimizations to improve overall performance
- Scalability - evaluate application's architecture and suggest enhancements to ensure it can handle increased user load and data volume. This may involve introducing caching mechanisms, database optimizations, or implementing distributed systems.
