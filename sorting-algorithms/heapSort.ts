/*

Heap sort is an in-place, non-stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It sorts the data in place and mutates the original data. It doesn't preserve the relative order or equal elements. If you have two elements with the same value in an unsorted collection, their relative order might be changed (or stay the same) in the sorted collection (non-stable). Finally, the elements are compared to each other to find their ordere (comparison-based).
